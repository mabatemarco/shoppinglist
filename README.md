# Shopping List App

## Description

As a lazy and shiftless person, I find it difficult to plan, shop for, and prepare meals during the week.  This app aims to help out those of us who use the excuse of these difficulties to order in for every meal.  The user will declare what type of meals (main, side, dessert) and food preferences and restrictions, and will return a selection of recipes the user can choose to accept.  After this, the user will be given a shopping list for the week.

## Problem Solving Approach
I had a very clear idea about what this app would do from the beginning, and knew it would consist of 3 main blocks: meal preference entry, displaying meals, and aggregating ingredients into a list.  Having a clear idea of how I wanted this to work allowed me to do the html and css first.  I then tackled the js one block at a time.

## Struggles
My biggest struggle during the building of this site was an instance where I could not get 2 functions to run with the correct timing.  I was able to solve this by combining the two functions into one.

## Remaining Problems
The ingredients listed on my api are not well standardized, and its difficult to combine them because of this.  One recipe may list 'garlic' as an ingredient, while another may list an ingredient as 'thinly sliced garlic.'  My site is unable to recognize that these are the same ingredient and list them separately.

## My Very Favorite Bits of Code
I was very happy with how I combined the ingredients together (though it's still imperfect).  I was also proud of how I was able to integrate so many different meal preferences and navigate the api.  I really like the function that alphabetizes the ingredients list, though I just found that.  I guess I'm proud of the person who wrote that.  Overall, I was really pleased with my work ethic on this, and I think I did a good job of focusing and working through problems, and was able to plan ahead what I was going to do before I started on it.
