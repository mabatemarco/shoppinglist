# Shopping List App

## Description

As a lazy and shiftless person, I find it difficult to plan, shop for, and prepare meals during the week.  This app aims to help out those of us who use the excuse of these difficulties to order in for every meal.  The user will declare which meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner) and how many of each they would like to have for the week, and will return a selection of recipes the user can choose to accept.  After this, the user will be given a shopping list for the week.
